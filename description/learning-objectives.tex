\section*{Learning objectives}

The following is a list of project-specific learning objectives:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Perform a security analysis, and identify safe security policies for

\begin{enumerate}

\item an online system;

\item arbitrary program execution; and

\item a basic learning management system.

\end{enumerate}

\item List, explain, and compare possible measures for enforcing the security
policies above.

\item Design and implement a system which enforces the security policies above.

\item Verify that the system mediates the threats identified in the analysis
above, using e.g.:

\begin{enumerate}

\item unit-testing;

\item property-based testing;

\item stress testing (e.g. many simultaneous submissions); and

\item penetration testing.

\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
