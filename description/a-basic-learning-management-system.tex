\section{A basic learning management system}

The system should enforce read and write permissions, disallowing students to
pose or change assignments, submit on other students behalf, view or change the
private information of teachers, their assistants, or other students, etc. The
system should stay programming language agnostic and allow the use of various
existing tools for the static and dynamic analyses of student programs, e.g.
compilers or linters. The use of tools installed natively on the system poses
its own security risks.

These are some the basic building blocks of a learning management
system\cite{lms}.
