\section{Arbitrary program execution}

We would like to stay programming language agnostic, so we constrain ourselves
to the operating system level.

The programs submitted by students and the analyses specified by teachers and
their assistants may, for all intents and purposes, be regarded as arbitrary
programs that may or may not adhere to some posed requirements. It may however
be assumed that the teachers and assistants have no incentive to deliberately
compromise the system.

We would like to ensure that all evaluations run in isolated environments, and
all students get a fair share of resources. This can be challenging to do when
student programs and the analyses are arbitrary programs.
