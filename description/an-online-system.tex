\section{An online system}

We would like an online system where students can make their submissions at
their leisure. This demands a moderate-sized web-based platform, capable of
handling many simultaneous submissions. As we are dealing with Computer Science
teachers and students, a command-line interface with the web-application would
suffice. This does not alleviate the system from many of the usual threats and
problems inherent with having a publicly facing web-application.
