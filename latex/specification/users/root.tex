\section{Users}

The online TA is to be made available on the World Wide Web. The set of users
therefore, includes a wide range of principals of which only a very small
subset will ever access the system, and even fewer are likely to use it as
intended.

The system should be safeguarded against malicious users, yet provide all the
relevant capabilities to authentic users with sufficient permissions.
