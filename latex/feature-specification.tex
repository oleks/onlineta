\chapter{Feature Specification}

% simplify teachers' assistants to just assistants.

% What is a course? It takes time.

\section{User Roles}

% (online TA is a bad name, since the service does more than a usual TA would,
% or at least, the online TA has more rights than a physical TA would.)

For an online TA there are two principal user roles: \emph{system
administrators} and \emph{participants}.

System administrators have complete control of the servers running the service,
including the mechanisms that enforce the security policies of the service.
(They can, in principle, change anything.) System administrators are also
responsible for monitoring the service for abnormal or abusive behaviour.

% (Ignoring or limiting system administrators would require ignoring or
% limiting anyone with the root access to the machine. This seems rather
% pointless.)

Participants access the system through a secure online interface. They set up,
enroll, and \emph{participate} in courses. A course is a collection of
programming assignments for the enrollees to solve.

There are three principle course-specific participant roles:
\emph{instructors}, \emph{assistants}, and \emph{students}.

Instructors are the principle course administrators. They can enroll other
participants as either instructors, assistants, or students. Their primary role
is to define the programming assignments of a course.

Assistants are second-level course administrators. They can enroll other
participants as assistants and students. Their primary role is to assist the
instructors in defining the programming assignments of a course.

Students are the basic users of a course. They cannot enroll other
participants. Their primary role is to attempt to solve the programming
assignments posed by the instructors and their assistants.

% When a teacher hires an assistant, the teacher sets up a trust relationship
% with the assistant. The assistant can do anything a teacher can, except kick
% teachers off the course.

% In principle we can let students set up their own courses, but this may incur
% additional complexities wrt. monitoring that don't seem to be worth dealing
% with at the moment.
