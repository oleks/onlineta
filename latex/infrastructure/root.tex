This chapter provides a high level overview of the chosen system architecture.
We justify our choices, as well as discusses some of their benefits and
downsides.

Our current approach keeps students and staff close to the command line (as
opposed to e.g. a web-based interface). The reason is part idealogical and part
practical. We believe that students become better programmers when kept close
to the command line. At the same time, it is easier to implement an
infrastructure where the integrity and the authenticity of the data can be
ensured. A myriad of tools exist,

Overall, there are three types of servers involved: a key server, a Git server,
and a test server. The communications between them and the students and
teaching staff are roughly illustrated by \referToFigure{infrastructure}. Each
type of server may in reality be a set of interconnected servers balancing
loads among each other, but fulfilling together the role of a single server
type.

architecture. All communication happens over secure channels. Both students and
staff interact with the key server and Git server, but students have
considerably less permissive rights on each of the servers}
