This chapter provides a high level overview of the chosen system architecture.
We justify our choices, as well as discusses some of their benefits and
downsides.

Overall, there are three types of servers involved: a key server, a Git server,
and a test server. The communications between them and the students and
teaching staff are roughly illustrated by \referToFigure{infrastructure}. Each
type of server may in reality be a set of interconnected servers balancing
loads among each other, but fulfilling together the role of a single server
type.

\includeFigure[0.75]{infrastructure}{Illustration of some of the system
architecture. All communication happens over secure channels. Both students and
staff interact with the key server and Git server, but students have
considerably less permissive rights on each of the servers}
