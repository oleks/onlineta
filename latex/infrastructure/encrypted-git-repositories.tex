\section{Encrypted and Signed Git Repositories}

Although unrelated to server infrastructure, this section is included in this
chapter as it is an important matter of the overall system infrastructure: this
section argues for a method of securely storing, digitally signed client data.

Git has built-in a method of signing tags (versions) or commits. Both require a
GPG signature.
