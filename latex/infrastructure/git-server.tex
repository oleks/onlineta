\section{Git Server}

The purpose of the git server is to serve as a general purpose data store for
both course content, assignments, and student submissions. It serves as a
gateway between students and staff, allowing for staff to publish course
content and assignments, and for students to make submissions.

\subsection{Why Git?}

Git is a popular\cite{ohloh-2014}, free, and open source distributed version
control and source code management system\cite{git-2014}. Although perhaps not
the ideal system for all intents and purposes, it is an excellent example that
has cemented itself in both the open source community, academia and
industry\cite{gitprojects-2014}.

Version control and code review are some of the Core- Tier1 and Tier2 elements
in \cite{cs-curricula-2013}, meaning that they are highly suggested topics for
any undergraduate Computer Science programme.

We hypothesize that using Git for programming assignments can spur the learning
of some of the workflow of modern software development. Ideally, students
collaborate on assignments, while the teaching staff offer code review, as if
it were a real software development project.

\subsection{Installation}

Pull the most recent version of git from your package manager.

Create a git user with shell /bin/git-shell (or similar).

Make sure he's passwordless.
