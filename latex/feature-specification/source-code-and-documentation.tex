\subsection{OSS/FS}

Open Source Software / Free Software (OSS/FS) programs are programs whose
licenses give users freedom to run the program for any purpose, to study and
modify the program, and to redistribute copies of either the original or
modified program\cite{why-oss-fs}.

To fully reap the benefits of OSS/FS, it is necessary to ensure that there is
an active community around it, devoted to bug tracking and fixing, as well as
developing new features (unless the product can be deemed feature-complete).

If such a community is absent, the worst fears of the sceptics of OSS/FS may
well be true: vulnerabilities may be known to adversaries.

% justifiable to use OSS/FS software as the building blocks of an online TA, as
% by \cite{why-oss-fs}.

% should the online TA itself be open sourced?

Developing software that later
