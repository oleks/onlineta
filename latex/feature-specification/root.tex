\chapter{Feature Specification}

We are interested in a online system for assistance with teaching
responsibilities. This involves the management of online assignments and
submissions, as well as providing the means for introducing automated
assessment steps.

 We are interested in a system that does more than provide for
the management of online assignments. It should suit the needs of the assessing
and the assessed, and so of both teachers, teaching assistants, and students.

% simplify teachers' assistants to just assistants.
