\section{Higher Education Organisation}

In the following sections we cover some other basic organisational aspects of
higher education. These are of relatively little interest to us, but do provide
some context for the assessments we wish to assist in.

\subsection{Course}

A course is a unit of education imparted in a series of learning activities.
The student performance in a course is always assessed, at least, on a
pass/fail/neither basis. A student passes a course, if the student has shown to
possess some predefined knowledge or skills by the end of the course, and fails
otherwise.  A student may neither pass nor fail in cases such as the student
dropping out of the course before any final assessment.

\subsection{Programme}

A programme in higher education is a series of courses that a student has to
pass. At the end of a programme the student is awarded a degree: a statement of
accomplishment in the courses passed.

\subsection{Institution}

A higher education institution is a legal entity that offers higher education
programmes. Typically this is a university or a college. Students are enrolled
for programmes at particular higher education institutions. Teachers and
teaching assistants are employed by a higher education institution. Other
actors in educational assessment have less clear relationships to such
institutions.
