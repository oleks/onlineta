\section{Assessment in Computer Science}

Computer Science is the study of computable structures and processes. Computer
Science graduates are (among other things) expected to be eloquent in the
theory and practice of computer programming\cite{cs-curricula-2013}.

To this end, practical work is a popular basis for assessment in Computer
Science\cite{carter-et-al-2003}. Practical work is concerned with the
composition of programs to be executed by a computer. To be executable by
computers, computer programs are written in highly rigorous languages, and so
are amenable to assessment with the assistance of computers.

The assessment of computer programs is a wide area of research and industry,
known as e.g. software verification or quality assurance.
