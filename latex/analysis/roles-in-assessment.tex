\section{Roles in Assessment}

There are two principal roles in assessment: the assessing and the assessed.
In education, the assessing are often also involved in the role of teaching,
and the assessed are often also involved in the role of learning.

Those involved in the role of assessing, but not in teaching, are involved in
either censure of the assessment, or are interested merely in the summative
purposes of an assessment. Those involved in the role of assessed, but not in
the role of learning, are of little interest to us.

\subsection{Teaching}

Teaching is the expediting of learning. Students learn on their own, but
teachers provide the conditions for more effective learning\cite{skinner-1965}.

\subsubsection{Teaching assistants}

Teaching assistants, as the name implies, assist teachers in their
responsibilities. It may vary in how far the assistance goes, or if there are
teaching assistants at all.

Teaching assistants come about as a scaling mechanism.

\subsection{Learning}

Learning is the gaining of knowledge or skills. It is a qualitative change of a
person's view of the world. Individuals engage in learning in hope of being
somehow enlightened or trained for solving particular kinds of problems.

\subsection{Censure and Summative Assessments}

Censure is a process of quality assurance of assessment. A censor's
participation in an assessment in an assessment varies from mere observation to
avid participation.
