\cite{sclater-howie-2003}  arrive at a set of ``ultimate'' requirements for an
online assessment engine. Their requirements represent the wishes of a focus
group at a particular institution, who have worked with similar engines before.
It is worth noting, that the focus group does not include students --- an
important user group.

Harvard has recently done a major redesign of their introductory Computer
Science course, CS50\cite{malan-2010a}. They've moved to securely executing
source code coming from students, and even arbitrary users on the
Internet\cite{malan-2010b,malan-2013}. Many of the techniques they use, are
(incidentally) also employed here.
