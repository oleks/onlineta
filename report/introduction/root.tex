In any teaching of the application of computers it is essential to have the
students do practical programming problems and to grade their results. Such
grading should consider both the formal correctness and the performance of the
programs and tends to become difficult and time consuming as soon as the
teaching is beyond the most elementary level.  The possibility of using the
computer to help in this task therefore soon suggests itself.

The above quote gives about as concise an introduction to the problem at hand
as we can hope to give. Being published in 1964, it also indicates that we are
about to embark upon a fairly long-standing problem --- we do not intend to
solve it here. Instead, we take a few first steps, enabling future work.

In this chapter, we make a few grounding definitions, discuss what programming
education looks like today, and discuss some of the reasons why a solution
remains elusive. If you feel confident about a section heading in this chapter,
feel safe to skip the section, but consider returning to it if in doubt about
the terminology in a subsequent chapter.
