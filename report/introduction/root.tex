In any teaching of the application of computers it is essential to have the
students do practical programming problems and to grade their results. Such
grading should consider both the formal correctness and the performance of the
programs and tends to become difficult and time consuming as soon as the
teaching is beyond the most elementary level.  The possibility of using the
computer to help in this task therefore soon suggests itself.
