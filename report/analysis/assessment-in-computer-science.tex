\section{Assessment in Computer Science}

Computer Science is the study of computable structures and processes. Computer
Science graduates are (among other things) expected to be eloquent in the
theory and practice of computer programming\cite{cs-curricula-2013}.

To this end, practical work is a popular basis for assessment in Computer
Science\cite{carter-et-al-2003}. Practical work is concerned with the
composition of programs to be executed by a computer.

To be executable by computers, computer programs are often written in highly
rigorous languages, and so are amenable to assessment with the assistance of
computers. The assessment of computer programs is a wide area of research and
industry, known as software verification or quality assurance.

With the advent of modern computer technology, computer programs can also be
assumed to be structured with the assistance of computers. Indeed, assemblers,
compilers, linkers, scripting engines, etc. have become ubiquitous. Students
can be, and often are, expected to acquire skills in using these tools on their
own, or with some facilitation from their teachers.
