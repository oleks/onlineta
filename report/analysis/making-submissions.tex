\section{Making Submissions}

We can rely on students to attempt to deliver their submissions in a digital
format, over an insecure network, e.g. the Internet. The network is insecure in
the following sense: it cannot guarantee that a particular submission
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)] \item comes from a particular student, nor \item that
it has not been tampered with by an adversary.\end{inparaenum}~We can mitigate
for this using symmetric cryptography and cryptographic signatures. This is
further discussed in \referToSection{infrastructure}.
