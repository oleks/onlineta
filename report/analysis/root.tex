\chapter{Analysis}

Students make submissions in response to assignments. We would like to assess
their work with the assistance of computers.

We can rely on students to attempt to deliver their submissions in a digital
format, over an insecure network, e.g. the Internet. The network is insecure in
the following sense: it cannot guarantee that a particular submission
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)] \item comes from a particular student, nor \item that
it has not been tampered with by an adversary.\end{inparaenum}

In assessing programming assignments, we distinguish between two types of
assessment. Static assessment is the analysis of a submission without executing
student programs. Dynamic assessment is the analysis of the runtime behaviour
of student programs. A static assessment often enables a subsequent dynamic
assessment, and sometimes runs in lockstep with it.
