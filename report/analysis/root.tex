\chapter{Analysis}

Students make submissions in response to assignments. We would like to assess
their work with the assistance of computers. We can do this by offering
students a hosted service, whereby students receive course content,
assignments, make submissions and receive feedback about their work.

In assessing programming assignments, we distinguish between two types of
assessment. Static assessment --- analysis of a submission without executing
student programs, dynamic assessment --- analysis of the runtime behaviour of
student programs. A static assessment often enables a subsequent dynamic
assessment, and sometimes runs in lockstep with it.
