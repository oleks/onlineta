\section{Course Content}

The feedback aside, the teaching staff would like to deliver the assignments
themselves and various learning material to students. We conjecture that
gathering all of these elements into one system provides a better interface
between the students and the teaching staff.

Having a single system for all this content opens up authenticity and
authorisation concerns: we would like to make sure that all users of the system
corresponds to a particular enrollee on the course (authentication), and that
their user permissions correspond to their enrollee roles (authorisation).
