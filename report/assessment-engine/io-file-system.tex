\section{I/O File System}

One way to share data between the host and a Linux container is using a shared
in-memory file system.

Once we've mounted a root file system (but before we pivot the root), we can
mount a \texttt{tmpfs} under the current (old) root, and bind mount it under
what will be the new root. Entering a new mount namespace, and pivoting the
root moves all dependencies on the old root to the new root, and so the bind
mound becomes a \texttt{tmpfs} mount inside the container, after the root is
pivoted.

Of course, nothing happens to the mount outside the mount namespace, and the
seemingly two \texttt{tmpfs} mounts indeed point to the same temporary file
system. This way, we can share a file system between a host and container
without giving access to a block device.

(See also the attached \texttt{./src/jail/sh-iofs} and
\texttt{./src/jail/monitor}.)
