When a student makes a submission, it needs to be assessed. The
assessment is specified by the teaching staff, and may consist of a range of
static and dynamic analyses, as well as a feedback processing step.

In general, we refer to these steps as the processes of an assessment. The
processes of an assessment, each run their own sandbox and communicate with
other processes using standard in/out, at most, files in an in-memory file
system. 

The combination of these sandboxed processes forms an assessment engine, taking
the student submission in at one end, and producing ``student-friendly''
feedback at the other.
