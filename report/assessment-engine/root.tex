This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because
that is a universal interface.

When a student makes a submission, it needs to be assessed. The
assessment is specified by the teaching staff, and may consist of a range of
static and dynamic analyses, as well as a feedback processing step.

In general, we refer to these steps as the \emph{processes} of an assessment.
The processes of an assessment, each run their own sandbox and communicate with
other processes using standard in/out, and perhaps an in-memory file system.
The combination of these sandboxed processes forms an \emph{assessment engine},
taking the student submission in at one end, and producing ``student-friendly''
feedback at the other.

The general approach to designing these processes is intended to be to monitor
a reference solution: which files, libraries does it need, how much memory and
CPU time does it need, etc. This data is then used to create a conservative
sandbox for running the processes of an assessment.
