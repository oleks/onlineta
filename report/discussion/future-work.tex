\section{Future Work}

Using Git for course content management may not be very user-friendly for
students in disciplines other than computer programming. Even beginning
computer programmers might find it perplexing.

Git gave us a simple way to retain multiple submissions to assignments,
multiple versions of assignments, and multiple versions of assignment feedback.
Git also gave us useful hooks which we used to provide for an encrypted data
store and a way for students to digitally sign their submissions. We also used
Git hooks to automatically trigger the assessment of a submission when it
arrives.

An interesting direction of future work would be to provide a more
user-friendly interface to all this, or find a way to achieve similar
objectives with e.g. a web-based platform. The major incumbent to this is our
idea of students encrypting and signing their submissions. One source of
inspiration, might be the new HTML5 \texttt{<keygen>} element\footnote{See also
