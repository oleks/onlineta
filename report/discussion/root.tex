% We've sketched some aspects of a system that may serve as a framework for
% performing automated assessment of practical work in computer programming
% courses. We've discussed many technologies that we can use both to provide
% sandboxed execution environments, as well as a safe and secure course
% management system. The techniques discussed provide for lightweight system,
% capable of guaranteeing a high level of safety, security and fairness in
% performing assessments and managing course data.

% Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the techniques described have only
% been tried out in a scratchbook fashion. They have not been all compiled into
% a system that is ready for demonstration at the time of writing.

For the purposes of discussion, we've created an Open Virtualization Appliance
(OVA) using VirtualBox, running Ubuntu 14.04, the server edition. We chose
Ubuntu, because it comes with user namespaces enabled by default (see also
\referToSection{sandboxing:namespaces:user}). The OVA is intended to
demonstrate some of the techniques discussed above.

% We've created a couple mirrors for the distribution of the OVA:

% \begin{itemize}

% \item TODO

% \end{itemize}

% The SHA-512 sum of the OVA file is: TODO.

We'll be using 4 system users: \texttt{onlineta} --- the system administrator,
\texttt{git} --- the Git user, and \texttt{kristian}, \texttt{louise}, and
\texttt{mikkel} --- students. For each user, their login password, OpenSSH, and
GnuPG password is their username.

We'll abuse the system administrator account for the tasks of the teaching
staff, and the Git user for running assessments. Ideally, each of these would
have their own dedicated users. In a real setting, students would not need to
have users on the system either. We do this for the purposes of a simple
demonstration.

You should be able to log into the OVA using SSH, once booted on your host.
For instance,

\begin{lstlisting}
$ ssh -p 2222 onlineta@127.0.0.1
\end{lstlisting}

If not, you may need to set up port forwarding in your OVA client. In the case
above, we forward host port 2222 to guest port 22.
