\section{Git Hooks}

Git hooks is a Git mechanism for executing custom scripts when important events
happen for Git repository\cite{man-5-githooks}. The scripts can control in how
far certain Git operations should succeed. A Git hook is an adequately named
executable placed in a special subdirectory in a local Git repository. Git
hooks are not part of the version-controlled code base of a repository.

For instance, the \texttt{update} hook is executed whenever the client attempts
to push something to a branch. The client has already been authenticated, but
no changes have yet been made. The hook is passed adequate arguments to
identify the branch or tag being updated and the update taking place. If this
hook exits with a non-zero exit value, the update will duly fail.

Other Git hooks are discussed in subsequent sections.
