\section{Users}

When using a Git server with OpenSSH, clients must be mapped to users on the
host. There are at least two options for the mapping: each client gets their
own user, or all clients map to the same user.

The first option has higher administration costs, but gives perhaps more
fine-grained access control. The second option is generally more popular
because of less cluttering of the UTS namespace. Additional tools, like
gitolite, are instead used to provide a fine-grained access control layer. We
have also chosen to go with this option. We name our user, \texttt{git}.
