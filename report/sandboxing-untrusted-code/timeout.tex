\section{Timeout}

\cite{man-1-timeout} is a simple user space utility that allows to send a
signal once a program exceeds a wall-clock time limit, e.g. \texttt{SIGTERM} or
\texttt{SIGKILL}. The applicability of this has already been discussed in
\referToSection{sandboxing:resource-limits}.

Unfortunately, as we had realised too late, using \cite{man-1-timeout} skews
CPU time measurements. The process and its children are frequently interrupted
to check if they haven't exceeded the wall-clock time limit (see also
\referToSection{discussion}).
